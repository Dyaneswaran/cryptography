# Cryptography
This repository supplies a basic implementation of the standard cryptogrpahic methods used to secure communications.

## Ciphers - 
> - Playfair
> - RailFence
> - Hill

## Public Key Cryptography - 
> - RSA 
> - Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

## Hashing Algorithms - 
> - MD5
> - SHA

## Encryption - 
> - DES


### TO-DO 

1. Integrate calculation of NxN Determinant in Matrix.java in HillCipher.java.
2. Make DES, MD5, SHA account for the empty string as well.
3. Extend RSA to implement RFC 3447. (Atleast the datatype conversions).


## References - 

1. Check out all the wikipedia documentations of the relevent topics.
2. Use this [link](https://cse.unl.edu/~ssamal/crypto/genhash.php) to validate your intermediate outputs in MD5, SHA algorithms.


Thank you, guys. Enjoy.
